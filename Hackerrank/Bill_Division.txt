Problem statement-
Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna’s portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct.

Solution-
This problem reminded me of my college civilization days where we each of the individual would contribute his share based on the food he/she ate.
Anyways,let move toward the problem at hand.Here we have to calculated or verify whether brain is not overcharging Anna.
The items(food) which they ate is stored in a list based,the values in the list is the cost of each food bill=[3,10,2,9].
k=1,it is the index of food in the list which Anna didn't eat so we have to subtract this from Anna’s share.
b=12, the amount of money that Anna contributed to the bill.

Let’s concentrate on code,here we first iterate the list(bill) and store the total addition of the cost of the bill in total_amount variable.
After that we calculate Anna’s share by subtracting the amount of food she didn't consume,then we check whether the bill provide and our calculation of Anna’s share matches or not.
Later we are just printing the difference between the proposed share amount and calculated one.

def bonAppetit(bill, k, b):
    total_amount=0
    for i in bill:
        total_amount+=i
    anna_share=(total_amount-bill[k])//2
    if anna_share==b:
        print("Bon Appetit")
    else:
        print(abs(anna_share-b))

Conclusion-
A simple problem today we learned about for-loop and remembering some old days….(cheers- PN)
