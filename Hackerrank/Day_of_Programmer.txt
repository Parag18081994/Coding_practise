Synopsis:-
Marie invented a Time Machine and wants to test it by time-traveling to visit Russia on the Day of the Programmer (the 256th day of the year) during a year in the inclusive range from 1700 to 2700.
From 1700 to 1917, Russia’s official calendar was the Julian calendar; since 1919 they used the Gregorian calendar system. The transition from the Julian to Gregorian calendar system occurred in 1918, when the next day after January 31st was February 14th. This means that in 1918, February 14th was the 32nd day of the year in Russia.
In both calendar systems, February is the only month with a variable amount of days; it has 29 days during a leap year, and 28 days during all other years. In the Julian calendar, leap years are divisible by 4; in the Gregorian calendar, leap years are either of the following:
1.Divisible by 400.
2.Divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100.

Question-Given a year y=1984 , find the date of the 256th day of that year according to the official Russian calendar during that year. Then print it in the format dd.mm.yyyy, where dd is the two-digit day, mm is the two-digit month, and yyyy is 12.09.1984.

Solution:-

The solution was very simple couple of if-else loop but the only catch was the condition of the year 1918 ,when the switch over of calendar from Julian to Gregorian happened.

Let first discuss the year before 1918,as calendar used us Julian in before the only condition we had to check was whether it was a leap year or not.if it is not a leap year then the 256ᵗʰ day of that year will be 12.09.YYYY and if it is a leap year then the 256ᵗʰ day of that year will 13.09.YYYY.

If the year is after the 1918 i.e we are in the Gregorian calendar age.Here again if its a leap year, the 256ᵗʰ day of that year will fall on 13.09.YYYY else for a non-leap year it will be 12.09.YYYY.

Now let concentrate on the year 1918,as on this year there was a switch over from Julian to Gregorian calendar .The next day after January 31st was February 14th. This means that in 1918, February 14th was the 32nd day of the year in Russia,15th February will be the 33rd day and so on the 256ᵗʰ day was 26.08.1918 as per the Julian calendar but on the Gregorian calendar the 256ᵗʰ would still be 13.09.1918.

Below is the entire code-

def dayOfProgrammer(year):
    if year>1918:
        if (((year%4==0) and (year%100!=0))or (year%400==0)):
            return "12.09."+str(year)
        else:
            return "13.09."+str(year)
    if year<1918:
        if (year%4==0):
            return "12.09."+str(year)
        else:
            return "13.09."+str(year)
    elif year==1918:
        return "26.09."+str(year)

Conclusion-

Today we have learnt the logic of leap year and how if-else pair works….(signing-off:-PN)
